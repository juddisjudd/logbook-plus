# Logbook+ — Aesthetics Guide

## Visual Direction

The UI must feel native to **Arc Raiders**: industrial, clean, slightly retro-futuristic, with sharp geometry and utilitarian panels.

## Key Traits

* **Color Palette**: muted neutrals, desaturated metallics, with sparse accent colors for highlights.
* **Typography**: **Barlow** font family (Regular 400, Medium 500, Bold 700) for condensed, high-legibility, HUD‑like appearance. Fallback to system sans-serif if unavailable.
* **Spacing**: compact but readable; avoid crowded grids.
* **Shapes**: rectangular panels with subtle bevels or inner shadows.
* **Effects**: light scanlines, matte gradients, and minimal glows.
* **Motion**: understated fades and slides.

## Overlay Behavior

* Must remain frameless and minimal.
* Draggable header region only.
* All controls must stay visually functional when partially transparent.

## Header Panel Style

* Title, version, and icons laid out horizontally.
* Icons should match Arc Raiders’ in‑world signage: simple, solid, no outlines.
* Close button should mimic a HUD glyph rather than a Windows control.

## Trackers

Each tracker section should:

* Mirror Arc Raiders’ panel styling.
* Use strong section headers.
* Keep scroll behavior smooth and unobtrusive.

## Consistency Requirements

* Every component must follow this guide.
* No web‑oriented layouts; desktop overlay only.
* All new UI elements must be reviewed against in‑game screenshots.`
